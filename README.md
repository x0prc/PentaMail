<br> A Mail Engine prepared with five key components (hence the name PentaMail) to explain the working of Public Key Infrastructure in Email Communication while making it encrypted along the way.

# The Flow of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) Algorithm
- Start: The beginning of the process.
- User A wants to send a secret message to User B: The motivation behind using PKI.
- User A generates a pair of keys: User A creates their public and private keys.
    - Public Key: The key that can be shared with anyone.
    - Private Key: The secret key that must be kept safe.
- User A shares Public Key with User B: User A sends their public key to User B.
- User B receives Public Key: Confirmation that User B has received the public key.
- User B puts message in box and locks it with User A's Public Key: User B encrypts their message using User A's public key.
- Locked message is sent to User A: The encrypted message is sent over the network.
- User A receives the locked message: User A gets the encrypted message.
- User A uses Private Key to unlock the message: User A decrypts the message using their private key.
- User A reads the message: The final step where User A can read what was sent.
- End: The process concludes.
